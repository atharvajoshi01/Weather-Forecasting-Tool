# Weather-Forecasting-Tool
Weather Forecasting Tool: AI-powered Python app using OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather forecasts. GitHub Copilot streamlines API integration, data parsing, and error handling. Get accurate weather information with ease.

# Features:

1. Fetches current weather data for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Parses the received weather data using Python to extract relevant information.
3. Displays the weather forecast to the user in a readable format.

# Key Components:

1. API Integration: The tool integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API by sending HTTP requests to retrieve weather data for a specific city. The API key and base URL are used to construct the API endpoint.

2. Data Parsing: The tool leverages Python's data parsing capabilities to extract relevant information from the received weather data. It retrieves details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

3. Command-Line Interface: The tool provides a command-line interface where users can input the city name for which they want to retrieve the weather forecast. It accepts the city name as an argument or prompts the user for input.

4. Error Handling: The tool incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues during API requests or data parsing. It notifies the user in case of any errors and provides appropriate error messages.

# Usage:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies.
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
4. Set the API key and base URL in the tool's configuration.
5. Run the tool and provide the city name as an argument or interactively enter the city name      when prompted.
6. The tool will fetch the weather forecast for the specified city and display it to the user.


This Weather Forecasting Tool demonstrates the usage of GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process, particularly in handling API integration, data parsing, and error handling tasks. It showcases how AI-powered assistance can enhance productivity and accuracy in building practical applications.
